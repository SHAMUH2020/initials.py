""" What is a List?
In programming, it is common to want to work with collections of data. In Python, a list is one of the many built-
in data structures that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order.

Remove the # in front of the definition of the list broken_heights. If you run this code, youâ€™ll get an error in your terminal:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Add commas (,) to broken_heights so that it runs without errors."""

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]

# broken_heights = [65 71 59 62]

# The correct line of code is:
broken_heights = [65, 71, 59, 62]
